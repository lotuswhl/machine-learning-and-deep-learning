## what does this folder contains?
> machine learning and deep learning code from scratch,mostly with numpy only.
## prerequisites
> fundamental machine learning theory and/or basic ideas for deep learning. python programming skill is required.



## What else?
> the code may not be efficient (definetely) for pratical usage.   
> please consult Other popular make learning or deep learning frameworks like tensorflow,pytorch,scikit-learn,cntk,mxnet,....etc.  
> I you want to understand how these machine learning and deep learning algorithms works,these codes would be a good choice.  
> They are easy to read and it's a good choice for you to get a good intuition.
