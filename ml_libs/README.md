machine learning and deep learning code from scratch,mostly with python only.

the code may not be efficient (definetely) for pratical usage. 

please consult Other popular make learning or deep learning frameworks like tensorflow,pytorch,scikit-learn,cntk,mxnet,....etc.

I you want to understand how these machine learning and deep learning algorithms works,these codes would be a good choice.

They are easy to read and it's a good choice for you to get a good intuition.
